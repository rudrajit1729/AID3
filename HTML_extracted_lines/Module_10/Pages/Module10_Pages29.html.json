{"content": {"Function calls": {"para_sentences": {"para_0": "We've already been using function calls to print values, read input, get the type of a value or variable, cast from one type to another, and to create ranges.

The above line would read input from the user, cast that input to a float, and then print out the result.", "para_4": "When you make a function call that returns a value, make sure you don't accidentally \"drop\" it.

Once the function is done, the computer returns back to the function call and continues from there. A function is done when the computer either reaches the end of the code in the definition, or it reaches a return statement, whichever happens first. A return statement doesn't have to go at the end of the function, and you can even have multiple return statements in a function. As soon as the code executes any return statement, it immediately ends the function and returns execution (and any return value) back to the function call.

Next the value of num is printed out, which is 8. We can see that even though val and num referred to the same value, changing val did not change num. This is not because of scope.
