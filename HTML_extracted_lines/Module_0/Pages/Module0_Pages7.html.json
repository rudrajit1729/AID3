The answer or explanation to these exercises are either provided within the task, or directly underneath. When asked to write code with many possible answers, you will complete the exercise once an equals sign (=) has been entered and your answer submitted. If you do not enter an equals sign in your code, the exercise will still release the feedback once you check your answer, but the exercise will not mark itself complete.
